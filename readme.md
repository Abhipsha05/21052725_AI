# Assignment 2 - Task 1: Reproducing an image using Genetic Algorithm

## Summary

In this project, we have taken a target image (Pepsi.jpg) and used a genetic algorithm for reproducing it.
For implementing the genetic algorithm, the PyGAD library is used.

## Steps to replicate

- Clone the repository
- Install the dependencies using the following commands:

    ```python
    pip install pygad
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install imageio
    ```

- Run the main.py file. A reproduction algorithm of 20000 iterations will begin to execute

## Contents of the repository

The "convertor.py" and "main.py" files are the main implementation of the project using the PyGAD library. Details of the exact working is explained in the Report.pdf file. 
Three folders of test runs 1,2,3 contain the fitness vs iteration graphs as well as the output image.
